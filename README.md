### Example Problem File (`two-sum.js`):

```javascript
/**
 * Problem: Two Sum
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
 * Output: [0, 1]
 * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return [];
};

// Example test case
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```
